## Install Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
- VPN Account from [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/toz) or [TorGuard](https://torguard.net/aff.php?aff=4350)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Server Configuration
1. [Install Ubuntu Server](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-server) and get it updated - `sudo apt update` then `sudo apt upgrade`
2. If you have existing media on a separate NTFS formatted drive:
 - Mount NTFS Drive w/ Appropriate Permissions, [Link 1](https://askubuntu.com/questions/113733/how-do-i-correctly-mount-a-ntfs-partition-in-etc-fstab#comment684545_113746)
 - `sudo blkid` - Find the block ID of your media drive
 - `sudo mkdir /media/Media` - make the mount point
 - Add to `/etc/fstab`: `UUID=BC6617A366175D88 /media/Media ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=022,fmask=133 0 0`
3. [Setup Samba Share](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20%28Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal%29%20-%20Uncomplicated%2C%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way%21) (to access media outside of HTPC)
4. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
 - You'll need to add your user running docker to the `docker` group. See [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
5. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
6. Clone Repo `git clone https://gitlab.com/phikai/htpc-docker-standup.git`
7. Copy Sample Environement File `cp sample.env .env`
8. Edit `.env` to match your environment
9. Run Docker Environment `docker-compose up -d`
10. ???
11. Profit.

### Environment File
- `LOCALUSER=` - This is the local user of your linux account and account running docker
- `HOSTNAME=` - Hostame of the server, can be found by executing `hostname` from command line
- `IP_ADDRESS=` - Local IP Address of the server, should be static
- `PUID=` - UID of the local user, can be found by executing `id` from the command line
- `PGID=` - GID of the local user, can be found by executing `id` from the command line
- `PMSTOKEN=` - The claim token for the server to obtain a real server token. If not provided, server is will not be automatically logged in. If server is already logged in, this parameter is ignored. You can obtain a claim token to login your server to your plex account by visiting [https://www.plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim)

- `VPNPROVIDER=` - Your VPN provider, name must match a folder specified in `ovpn`. This defaults to `pia` if you copied `sample.env`.
- `VPN_REMOTE=` - The remote server you want to connect to (must support port forwarding)
- `CIDR_ADDRESS=` - IP/netmask entries which allow access to the server without requiring authorization. We recommend you set this only if you do not sign in your server. For example `192.168.1.0/24,172.16.0.0/16` will allow access to the entire `192.168.1.x` range and the `172.16.x.x`
- `TZ=` - Set the timezone inside the container. For example: `Europe/London`. The complete list can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
- `PMSTAG=` - Which version of Plex Media Server, available options: `latest`, `plexpass` and `public`. You should use `latest` unless you have special requirements or are a Plex Pass subscriber.
- `EMAIL=` - Email address to be used for Let's Encrypt SSL certificate validation - `someone@somewhere.com`
- `DOMAIN=` - Public domain to use for accessing services via a public domain - `server.domain.com`
- `WATCHTOWER_EMAIL=` - Email address you'd like Watchtower to notify for any notifications - `someone@somewhere.com`
- `SMTP_FROM=` - From address that your SMTP server uses to send email - `someone@somewhere.com`
- `SMTP_SERVER=` - Servername of your SMTP server - `smtp.domain.com`
- `SMTP_PORT=` - Port that your SMTP server uses to connect - `587`
- `SMTP_USER=` - Username that your SMTP server uses to authenticate
- `SMTP_PASS=` - Password for your SMTP user to authenticate
- `SPEEDTEST_INTERVAL=` - Number of seconds between tests to the [Speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) services
- `TRAEFIK_AUTH=` - Basic Auth for the Traefik Admin [htpasswd Generator](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/)
- `STACK_NAME=` - This is used to specify the appropriate network Traefik should use. See #13 for details.

### Email/SMTP Service
- [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html) has an excellent QuickStart Guide
- Check out the sending via [SMTP](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#send-via-api)
- Make sure to also [verify your domain](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#verify-your-domain)
